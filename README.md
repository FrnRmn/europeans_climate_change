### Motivation
With this analysis I explored the European Social Survey dataset of 2016/2017 to gather some insights on climate change beliefs of many European countries.
1. Do Europeans acknowledge the relevance of climate change?
2. Are there some hidden beliefs that might undermine a fast and efficient problem resolution?
3. Do European countries have different problems and so different directions of improvement?
4. Are there apparently unrelated factors that are instead related to climate change beliefs?

### Results
The main results from this analysis are described in this [post](to add link).
